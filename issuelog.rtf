issue report by LingZhang.  ----solved \
\
 I just download the php files from our google drive, when I run it, it always show\
( ! ) Warning: Unknown: failed to open stream: Permission denied in Unknown on line 0\
( ! ) Fatal error: Unknown: Failed opening required '/Users/lingzhang/Sites/nova_movie/index2.php' (include_path='.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php') in Unknown on line 0\
\
but if I copy the code to create another file in my computer, then it works fine.\
after google, I think this might be file permission issue,\
I tried to change the mode to 755\
\
in terminal, use "sudo chmod -R 755 /Users/lingzhang/Sites/", then it works\

\f1\fs24 \cf0 I fix the problem that the footer won't be at the bottom all the time when you need to scroll down.\
add the following to the css:\
\
.wrapper\{\
	min-height: 100%;\
	height: auto !important;\
	height: 100%;\
	margin: 0 auto -2em;\
\}\
.footer, .push\{\
	height: 2em;\
\}\
then add:\
\'a0 <div id="main">\
	<div class="wrapper">\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0 ................\
\'a0 \'a0 \'a0 \'a0</div>\
</div>\
to the .php file\
